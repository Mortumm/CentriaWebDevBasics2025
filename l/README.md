### Feedback & Reflection
   
The tasks given to us, especially the later ones in the course, were fun to do.   
   
Actual landing page to implement with practical learning and real world result. I wouldn't neccessarily aim to be a front end dev based on this experience, but it sure is fun and rewarding to work with visual elements and take proper consideration on the user experience.   

The foundation of the landing page was built with HTML and CSS, ensuring a clean and responsive design. This could be further enhanced by going for a framework like Tailwind CSS or maybe even Vue.js, which provides a more robust and scalable solution for building web applications. TypeScript would be the choice then, but still something I would have to dive into deeper. Possibilities on the front end part are endless. Even so, I might take off with this landing page / website as a starting point for my journey into htmx (going for that simplicity).     
   
The feedback was encouraging, only the fact that the validators used by me (Think it's the same W3C HTML validator though), gave me zero errors, unlike for the lecturer it seems. Small corrections site wide to keep it consistent. The site should work decently on desktop and mobile, UI/UX testing was done with Firefox and Google Chrome responsive-tool in the Developer Tools without bigger issues.

### Feedback & Reflection
   
The tasks given to us, especially the later ones in the course were fun to do. Actual landing page to implement with practical learning and real world results. I wouldn't neccessarily aim to be a front end dev based on this experience, but it sure is fun to tinker and find the layout one is personally happy with.

The feedback was couraging, only the fact that the validators used by me gave me zero errors, unlike for the lecturer it seems.

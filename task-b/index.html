            <p>
                Intro for the contents of this repository: Basics of WebDev
                assignments are found here, exploring the principles of HTML,
                HyperText Markup Language, CSS Cascading Style Sheets and
                JavaScript. A familiar topic to myself but still very eager to
                see what parts of the plain web tools could or even better,
                should be used in todays development cycles.
            </p>
